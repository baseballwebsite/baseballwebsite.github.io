        <p>
          New rules are now being placed for the 2020 season such as the three-batter minimum that
           now states that a pitcher has to face three batters before they can be removed. There are
            also new roster rules such as the 14-pitcher limit in 28 person rosters and 13 in 25.
             Pitchers are also now having a 15 day minimum rest when they are injured.
