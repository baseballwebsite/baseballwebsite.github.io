        <h1>High School Rules:</h1>
        <p>
          High school games are 7 innings while college and pro are 9 innings. There are also
           different rules on DDs or designated hitters, and they can be used in all games. They
            are also rules about runners touching fielders; if the fielder blocks his path the runner
             must find a different way.
