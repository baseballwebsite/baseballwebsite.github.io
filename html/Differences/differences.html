        <h1>Rules: </h1>
        <p>
          Though there are not many rule differences in college and professional baseball, the differences do alter the game dramatically. This article talks about these differences and how they alter the game.
        </p>

        <h1>Physical Contact: </h1>
        <p>
          One major rule change in college and professional baseball is the after effects of physical contact.
          In college baseball, physical contact in an attempt to make the other player drop the ball is discouraged, against the rules, and players can be ejected because of such actions.
          The major reason for this is to eliminate collision plays at the home plate between the catcher and the base runner.
          Normally catchers will give players a free run when coming home to eliminate the occurrence of collisions.
          When the runner makes contact with the catcher, it is up to the umpire to determine the intent of the play.
          In professional baseball, however, physical contact at the home plate is not discouraged.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Mercy Rule: </h1>
        <p>
          The mercy rule basically states that if a team is ten or more runs ahead and the other team has had seven innings, the winning team basically has mercy on the other and they get a win by default.
          This rule only takes place in tournament play and sundays.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Get away Rule: </h1>
        <p>
          The get away rule is a rule to maintain the integrity of learning in college baseball players. The get away rule basically states that if a game runs past 6PM on a Sunday, the game is called.
          When this rule is called and atleast five innings have been played, the team that is up wins. Otherwise, the game is erased. If the game continues to be rained out after, it is eliminated from the schedule.
          If the game is eliminated, the two teams can schedule another game against other teams to make up the missed game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Aluminum Bats: </h1>
        <p>
          The use of aluminum bats in professional baseball is prohibitted due to safety reasons and because many people would always hit home runs.
          This is different from the college leagues where the use of aluminum bats is not prohibitted.
