        <p>
          The truth about the chances of playing pro in the major leagues only 5 to 6% ever play a single day
          and 40% of draft picks never play and most only play for four years if they become injured or get
          replaced and the those who do make it are drafted from high school instead of college ball. However
          the age is slowly increasing and they are lasting longer in the league.

          College ball is very different as many more kids are scouted and have the opportunity to play
          as they get a degree. They also have a strict structure and have to meet a high level of standards.
          College ball also have many levels so even a lower end player can be drafted to a minor school.
